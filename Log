10/22/2017 12:23 : Created Patient Homescreen
  Process:
    Used 'reactive-native-elements' to create buttons and header
    documentation can be viewed at https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/
  Need to fix:
    Buttons should include pictures detailing each button's functionality
    Buttons should look nicer
    Did not follow specific header detailed in Balsamiq, can change if needed
    Currently Patient homescreen is hosted in the front of the app, will need to destructure and place screen in own file

11/3/2017 0936: Deprecated Patient Home Screen and Implemented Stack Navigation
  Process:
    Used 'react-navigation' to create Stack
    documentation can be viewed at 'https://reactnavigation.org'
    Moved Patient Homescreen to separate file
  Need to fix:
    Clean code in App.js
    Redo the headers, currently there are two headers in the patient homescreen
    Need to create button component to put in Header for navigation
